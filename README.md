#screen translator
android app
turn a sentence into fragments and each fragments can be tapped to open a pop up that translates each fragments
and shows some sort of dependency between fragments and what they mean
#first way
take screenshot and translate it using some free ai api
#second
use some non ai libraries to fragment words and look it up using dictionary 
#third
local transformer shits to fragment sentence, clamp or use diffrent buzzy sounding shit to distinguish fragments between fragments
